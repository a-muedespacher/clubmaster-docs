Prerequirements
---------------
In order to run this software you need to following prerequirements:

- Webserver
- PHP 5.3.2
- MySQL 5

Besides it higly suggested to:

- Enable mod_rewrite for apache
- AllowOverride All in your apache configuration


Installation
------------
In order to install ClubMaster, do the following:

- Extract files to your server
- Create the database
- Locate the web/setup.php folder in your browser, and follow onscreen installation


Upgrade
-------
To upgrade from a previously version of ClubMaster, do the following:

- Backup the database
- Backup the old files
- Extract the new project in top of the old
- Visit the page /upgrade, and follow the onscreen information

[NOTE]
In version 1.2 we will introduce a new way of migration that will go much easier than before, unfortunately that will result in no way to upgrade from version 1.1 to 1.2.


Configuration
-------------
In app/config/clubmaster.yml if will find a config file, where you can change almost anything in the system.

You can enable and disable different modules, you should take a look at this file in order to fit ClubMaster to your needs.


Mail Templating
---------------
The system will send mails out at different events. The filenames should explain pretty good when the mail is sent out.

You can find all the templates in:

src/Club/MailBundle/Resources/views/Template/

If you want to change any of the context of the default messages ClubMaster send out, you should make a copy of the folder to:

app/Resources/ClubMailBundle/views/Template/

Just give the files the exact same name, and you can do whatever you like with the messages.
